The data file "joint/averages.txt" contains aggregated data from the study described under http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones . From the original data, only mean values and standard deviations, with respect to time or frequency, of various measurements were considered and further aggregated by calculating the average with respect to each subject(i.e. participant in the experiment) and each activity.
The data table is complete, i.e. each field contains valid data. All data are normalized into the range [1-,1].
Below a list of all data present in the data file "averages.txt", located in the directory "joint/", is provided.
The name of each feature is followed by a pair of parentheses, which provide some specific information on the type of the data:
1. The domain of the data, which may be time or frequency domain.
2. The type of the data. "mean" refers to the arithmetic mean, and "std" to the standard deviation.
3. For vectorial quantities, the direction represented by the associated data.
